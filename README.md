👋 Hi, I’m Kai. I'm a software engineer living in Santiago, Chile.

👀 I’m interested in programming languages, functional programming,
type theory and distributed systems in general. I'm not formally
trained in any of those subjects and mostly strive for a sufficient
level of understanding that allows me to relate concepts with
knowledge from other fields.

Lately I gained special interest in the various system monitoring
stacks out there, such as prometheus and netdata, which I find
incredibly cool and well made.

I'm also interested in the preservation of human rights worldwide,
although I don't actively do much about it and mostly limit myself to
watching and worrying.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about distributed monitoring systems,
taking my time while I try to mix prometheus remote write feature
with a custom DAG engine I'm building. I don't expect to achieve
anything concrete out of this, but I'm enjoying it so far.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mostly anything that interests me,
technically or ethically speaking.

📫 You may reach me through email, and you should expect me to respond
within three days, unless I'm under heavy work load.
